After two excellent months, out time at <a
href="http://www.saikhaoinn.com">Sai Khao Inn</a> is over for this
time. (The initial plan was to stay here four weeks, but White Sand
beach and the Sei Khao Inn was was simply so nice that we got stuck
here.) Since we have three kids, we rented a whole house to
ourselves. Two bedrooms and one big room with a sofa and a tv. There
was also a small kitchen part with fridge and freezer. (And three
toilets!)

The service was really good. We felt really taken care of by the
staff. They always tried to help us wether it was regarding a clogged
toilet, a jammed door lock, or a rush trip to the hospital.

They even threw us a farewell BBQ at our last night. Other residents
at the inn provided live music and a magician... We had a blast!

We would warmly recommend Sai Khao Inn to anyone looking for
accomodation in White Sand Beach on Koh Chang!
